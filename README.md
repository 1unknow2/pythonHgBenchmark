Mercury Benchmarking for Python

-Brittany Walker started translating GEOS-Chem IDL benchmark code to Python (Feb 2019)

-Ari Feinberg continued adding new benchmark functionalities (June 2021)

This directory contains a set of python scripts used to benchmark new and updated versions of the GEOS-Chem mercury model. 
For now I use main.py to call functions and plots. However, eventually I will add a Jupyter Notebook as another option for 
running the benchmark. 

Also included are various data to which the model versions are compared found in the folder data. 

The Benchmarks aim is to compare and analyse data from a new model run to a reference model run. For this you will need the
output netcdf files generated by the model run. You will need to specify the location of these files.

Summary of scripts and their function:

main.py : Main file for calling functions

helper_functions.py : General helper functions for loading and averaging model data 

TGMAndObs.py : Plot the mean surface TGM for mercury against different sites for the reference and new models.

Hg2Plot.py : Plot the mean surface Hg2+HgP for the reference and new models.

Latitudinal_Graphs.py : Plot observations against the model as latitudinal gradient and seasonal cycles at different latitudes

PlotSeasonSites.py : Plot the reference and new models against the observations made at each site for a year. 

SiteLevels.py : Dictionary of all of the sites with different levels other than 0 at the surface.

diff_plots_Hg.py : General plotting script to plot reference, new, and difference (absolute and relative) maps for an Hg variable

Packages you will need to run this are xarray, matplotlib, cartopy, numpy, pandas, and scipy
